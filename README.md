# Marsville

[Gamedev.js Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2022) entry

Idle game where you need to collect raw resources on the Mars while expanding your base.

Game is using NEAR protocol blockchain in order to save the base state. Since build action is a single transaction in blockchain and every transaction costs some price, game is only using Testnet which provides free test accounts. You would need to register your wallet on https://wallet.testnet.near.org/ in order to play.
